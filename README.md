# PrologVM

Project:
C++ based Prolog Virtual Machine

This project is a self-contained shortcut allowing a “hitchhiker” to Prolog
implementation to get the core of an efficient-enough Prolog system .


The Aim of this Project is to covert a C++ equivalent of the Prolog System developed in Java.
The Project needs to be developed following various Software Engineering principles.
