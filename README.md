# PrologVM

Project: C++ based Prolog Virtual Machine

The Aim of this Project is to covert a C++ equivalent of the Prolog System developed in Java. The Project needs to be developed following various Software Engineering principles.

This project is a self-contained shortcut allowing a “hitchhiker” to Prolog implementation to get the core of an efficient-enough Prolog system .Prolog’s execution algorithm is seen as iterated unfolding of a goal with heads of matching clauses and some low-level aspects of unification, that tend to be among the most frequently called operations of a Prolog machine.

Usage:
./go.sh add
